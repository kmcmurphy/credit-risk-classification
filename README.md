Credit Risk Classification

This project uses a supervised machine learning model to categorize the creditworthiness of borrowers by spliting them into low and high risk groups. It first uses logistical regression with the standard data and then logistical regression with resampled data, based on the imbalance of borrower types.

The results:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
